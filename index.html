        <h1>Welcome to BitVM Online</h1>
        <p>To run the bitvm there are seven steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick a program</li>
            <li>Act as the prover to commit to a certain output</li>
            <li>Send money to the program</li>
            <li>Act as the prover to share which "inputs" make the code produce the expected output</li>
            <li>Act as the verifier to check if the code, with those inputs, produces the expected output</li>
            <li>If it does, act as the prover to take the money after a timelock</li>
            <li>Otherwise, act as the verifier to take the money by producing the error</li>
        </ol>

            <li>This is a toy implementation, don't expect much.</li>
            <li>I wrote the VM in about 200 lines of javascript which means it barely works.</li>
            <li>It breaks if you put a program with more than about 3000 logic gates in it. <a
                    href="https://github.com/supertestnet/tapleaf-circuits/" target="_blank">Help me write a better
                    one!</a></li>
            <li>The whitepaper talks about using "binary search" in a challenge to find the shortest path to prove your
                counterparty is equivocating. I don't know how to program a binary search so I just didn't. Instead, if
                you challenge the prover, he has to *prove the entire computation himself, all on chain.* Which is very
                dumb, and expensive. But I wasn't trying to make it the smart way, I was trying to make it the easy way.
                Help me improve it!</li>
            <li>If Paul doesn't send Vicky the data he promised, she is technically able to take his money after a 10
                block timelock, but I didn't automatically give her a transaction for this like I did for Paul. So she's
                just out of luck til I do that. (Or you can figure out how to write bitcoin transactions manually and do
                it yourself.)</li>
            <li>Paul doesn't make Vicky pay him, or even check if her signatures on the presigned transactions are
                correct. He just yolos his money right into the bitvm address with no checks or balances, so Vicky can
                easily steal from him by just immediately moving it into the challenge address without presigning the
                transaction that lets him take it out again. Fixing that is on my todo list. So is having Vicky pay Paul
                for the computation.</li>
            <li>There are a bunch of other caveats but whatever, it technically works! I'm really looking forward to
                testing more functions with this. Bitcoin can run *anything* guys! Let's write some functions for it!
